I live in London and have done for my entire life. Things I like: Nice web design, Typography, Cupcakes. Things I dislike: British weather, Confusing Instruction Manuals, Dust on lenses. Some of my skills are being indecisive and recognising <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> references. In school, I enjoy languages (I'm taking French, Russian and Spanish this year) and Physics. Regarding alternative languages, I know basic Python, PHP and small fragments of Ruby. I also do HTML and CSS (of course). I'm bad at almost every sport, an exception being Quidditch. When I'm not being lazy, I take photos with my modest film camera collection (and my 600D).</p></div></div>
