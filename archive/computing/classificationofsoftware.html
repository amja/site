				<h3> System Software </h3>
				<h4> Operating Systems </h4>
				<p> Operating Systems are the interface between the computer and the user. They allow the hardware to be used without accessing it directly. In order for this to happen the Operating System creates a 'virtual machine', which hides the complexity of the hardware from the user with an alternate interface. Operating Systems create the platform from which other pieces of software run, and thus most applications are written for a specific Operating System: for instance, a program written to run on *Non-specific Brand* PCs using Linux might not run on *Non-specific Brand* PCs using GNU</p>
				<h4> Library Programs </h4>
				<p> Library Programs are collections of compiled routines which will be used by multiple other programs: a good example are print routines, which will be used by both word processors and spreadsheet programs. </p>
				<h4> Utility Programs </h4>
				<p> Utility programs perform specific tasks, like file compression or disk formatting. Normally some are bundled with the Operating System, while others can be downloaded. </p>
				<h4> Language Translators </h4>
				<p> These are not translators between human languages, but between types of code language. Computers can only run Machine Code, and if a program is in a higher-level programming language a translator is necessary in order to exxecute it.</p>
				<h4> Assemblers </h4>
				<p> An assembler is a program that translates assembly language into machine code. Each expression in turn is converted to the binary equivalent. </p>
				<h4> Compilers </h4>
				<p> A compiler converts a whole program in a high-level code directly into object code. The resulting translation can then be distributed without the need for real-time translation </p>
				<h4> Interpreters </h4>
				<p> An interpreter analyses and executes each line of a high-level language program individually in sequence. This means the program must be interpreted every time it is run. The program can be executed much faster than compiling, at least initially, but must be interpreted every time, and thus is slower in the long term than a compiled program, and also allows for easier copying of source code. </p></section>

				<h3> Application Software </h3>
				<h4> Bespoke Software </h4>
				<p> Bespoke software is custom software developed for a specific customer, who pays for all the development costs. A good example is Department Store stock and department organisation software </p>
				<h4> General-Purpose Software </h4>
				<p> General-purpose software can be used for a variety of purposes. Good examples are word processors or graphing software. </p>
				<h4> Special-Purpose Software </h4>
				<p> Special-purpose software is designed for a specific task, but not a single consumer. Good examples are Air Traffic Control software that might be shared between multiple airports and web browsers.</section>

				<h3> Generations of Programming Language </h3>
				<h4> First Generation Languages </h4>
				<p> Machine Code - the only language a computer can execute directly. Unique to a family of processors. </p>
				<h4> Second Generation Languages </h4>
				<p> Assembly Code - Uses same structure as Machine Code, but uses mnemonics rather than numbers. </p>
				<h4> Third Generation Languages </h4>
				<p> Imperative languages - must be executed in a programmer-defined sequence. Also known as 'procedural languages'. </p>
				<h4> Fourth Generation Languages </h4>
				<p> Declarative Programming Languages - define what needs to be done, rather than how to do it. Used to write or declare facts that the computer interprets and executes. </p></section>
