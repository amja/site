      <p>The internet is a network of networks. It began in the 1960s, along with <a href="http://www.wussu.com/poems/plam.htm">sex</a> and drugs. All the computers on the internet are part of the global namespace governed by TCP and IP.</p>

      <section id="packets" class="line">

        <h3>Packets</h3>

        <p>Whenever some information needs to be sent from one place to anther, it must be split up into packets. Usually, these packets are around <a href="http://etherealmind.com/average-ip-packet-size/">576 bytes</a>.</p>

        <p>Each packet contains  (as well as the data it is carrying) the IP address and port of the place it is headed and the place it came from, so that any data can be returned.</p>

        <p>The packets are sent by different routes to the destination, to make it less likely that they are all lost in transmission if one route fails.</p>

        <p>The <strong>end-to-end principle</strong> states that the two end computers should be in control of establishing, maintaining and supervising the communication and that the internet's only role is to move packets between them.</p>

        <p>
          The <strong>client-server model</strong> is the scenario when a process on the client machine initates a connection to a server and sends a request, and then the server responds to that request.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="tcp_ip" class="line">

        <h3>TCP IP Stack</h3>

        <p>All the information that travels through the internet passes up and down the network stack.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Application</li>
          <li>Transport</li>
          <li>Network</li>
          <li>Link</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Application Layer</h4>
          <p>The application layer deals with the protocols that are specific to each type of traffic, e.g. FTP for file transfers, HTTP(S) for the web, SSH for remote shells etc.</p>

        <h4>Transport Layer</h4>
          <p>This is the layer that TCP (and UDP) operate on. They follow the <strong>end-to-end</strong> principle. TCP enables a reliable flow of data from one computer to another (making sure that all the data gets to the destination) and deals with splitting the data into packets so the applications do not have to.</p>
          <p>TCP is resposible for error checking and resending of any dropped packets as well as maintaining the connection so the applications do not have to.</p>
          <p>
            It adds the source and destination TCP port onto the packet, so one device can maintain many connections simultaneously on different port numbers.
          </p>


        <h4>Network Layer</h4>
        <p>
          The network layer is responsible for addressing the packets so the routers know where to send them, as well as a return address so the routers know where to send the response. This is in the form of an IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of the IP address and port number is called a socket.
        </p>

        <h4>Link Layer</h4>
        <p>
          The link layer is the last layer in the stack, dealing with the hardware. It adds source and destination hardware (MAC) addresses to the packets, and then dispatches them onto the network (usually down an Ethernet cable or over a WiFi network).
        </p>

        <h4>Encapsulation</h4>

        <p>
          The result of passing packets up and down the stack is that the data is "encapsulated" several times, with the data at the middle, the TCP ports, then the IP addresses, and then the hardware addresses.
        </p>

      <section id="hardware" class="line">

        <h3>Hardware</h3>

        <p>
          There are only a few different types of hardware on the internet.
        </p>

        <h4>Routers</h4>

        <p>
          Routers receive packets and forward them on according to their destination IP addresses. A router is in charge of allocating IP addresses to devices that are underneath it in the network tree.
          Sometimes this means passing it up the chain to another router, and sometimes it can send it directly to a host that is connected to it. It uses subnet masks to figure out whether or not it is in charge of the destination host.</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Gateways</h4>

        <p>
          Gateways are used to transport traffic from one link-layer type to another (e.g. from WiFi to Ethernet, Ethernet to Fibre etc). Any router that includes WiFi is also a gateway.
        </p>

      <section id="protocols" class="line">

        <h3>Common Protocols</h3>

        <p>
          Protocols are a set of agreed rules governing communication between two systems, usually specialised to one use.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            HTTP (Port 80): Insecure Web
          </li>
          <li>
            HTTPS (Port 443): Secure Web
          </li>
          <li>
            FTP (Port 20 &amp; 21): Insecure File Transfers
          </li>
          <li>
            SSH (Port 22): Secure Remote Console
          </li>
          <li>
            Telnet (Port 23): Old, bad remote console
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ports 0-2013 are ports which are universally used by servers for different purposes. Client port numbers, on the other hand, are 1024 upwards and are used by client processes and are temporary.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="topology" class="line">

        <h3>Network Topology</h3>

        <p>
          Each company/school/home nowadays has one "main" router with a connection to the internet. All devices on the LAN (local area network) of the private routers are "hidden" behind that router, such that the outside world cannot differentiate between them as they only have one global IP address.
          These private routers are then connected to local routers, regional routers and finally national routers which are also connected to the international network.
        </p>

        <p>
          IP addresses are allocated by region, so you can tell the location of a host by its IP address. Local IP addresses on the router's (private) network are in the range of 10.*.*.* , 192.168.*.* or 172.16.*.* to 172.31.*.*.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="domains" class="line">

      <h3>Domain Names &amp; URIs</h3>

        <p>
          Domain names are essentially human-memorable aliases for IP addresses, e.g. stpaulsschool.org.uk. When a user wants to send data to that domain, their computer first translates that into an IP address using a DNS server, which keeps a list of which domains correspond to which IP addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>domain name</strong> can have multiple IP addresses associated with it, for instance one for each type of server. A <strong>fully qualified domain name (FQDN)</strong> is a domain name that refers to a single IP address (e.g. mail1.stpaulsschool.org.uk).
        </p>

        <p>
          Domain names are made up of levels of domain. For instance, mail.stpaulsschool.org.uk has these levels:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            mail: the subdomain
          </li>
          <li>
            stpaulsschool: the domain
          </li>
          <li>
            org: the second level domain
          </li>
          <li>
            uk: the first level domain
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>URIs</h4>

        <p>
          A <strong>URI</strong> is a uniform resource identifier and it specifies how to access a resource of the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <strong>URL</strong> on the other hand is a uniform resource locator or a URI that identifies a resource by its network location.
        </p>

        <p>
          Take this URI for example: <em>https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk:2000/stuff.html</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The first part is the protocol to be used, in this case HTTPS. Next is the domain name of the webserver that we want. Everything after the colon is the port to be used. If it is omitted, the default port for that protocol is used (443 in this case). Everything after the port number is the location of the document to be accessed on the server.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="web" class="line">

        <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>

        <p>
          The web is a system interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. They can be accessed using web browsers or anything else that can speak HTTP(S).
        </p>

        <p>
          Intranets, on the other hand, are private computer networks that are owned by an organisation to share information with its employees using Internet protocols.
