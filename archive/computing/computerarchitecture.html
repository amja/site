            <h2>Internal hardware and external components of a computer</h2>
            <h3>Three-box model</h3>
            <p>Computer systems can be simply modelled using three "boxes":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#processor">Processor</a></li>
                <li><a href="#storage">Storage</a></li>

            </ul>
            <div id="processor">
                <h3>Processor</h3>
                <p>
                    The processor controls the system - it's the brain. it's Responsible for proper functioning of other parts of the system.
                </p>
                <p>Modern processors contain millions of transistors. As of 2015, the highest transistor count is Intel's <em>Xeon IvyBridge</em> with over 4.3 billion transistors. Number of transistors on a specific area of silicon is said to double every 18-24 months. This is called <strong>Moore's Law</strong>, named after <em>Gordon E. Moore</em>, co-founder of Intel.</p>
                <p>In the past, <strong>CPU</strong> was used to describe the processor plus main memory. Since the introduction of microprocessors, it now just refers to the microprocessor.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="storage">
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                <p>In principle, the <strong>main memory</strong> is the simplest part of the computer. In a <em>von Neumann</em> computer, it is used as a store for program instructions and data. Made out of memory chips. Each byte goes into a separate area of the chip called a <strong>memory location</strong>. Main memory is made up of <strong>RAM</strong> chips but can also contain <strong>ROM</strong>.</p>
                <h4>RAM</h4>
                <p><strong>Random access memory</strong> is used both to read and to write. It's used by the processor to store data and then load it back. Ram is volatile - the data is lost when the power is turned off.</p>
                <h4>ROM</h4>
                <p><strong>Read-only memory</strong> is not lost when power turned off - contents <em>non-volatile</em>. It is random access but once set up, cannot be written to. It's used to hold programs like the bootstrap program.</p>
                <h4>EEPROM</h4>
                <p><strong>Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory</strong> does allow contents to be altered. However, takes much longer (over 100x) to write than to read. Flash memory is faster to write than other types of EEPROM because blocks written in one go rather than per byte. Widely used in commercial applications needing non-volatile storage e.g. SIM cards, flash storage for cameras, memory in MP3 players.</p>
                <h4>Bus</h4>
                <p>The "three boxes" are connected by a bus called the <strong>system bus</strong>. Can transmit a single binary word between processor and the store or I/O component.</p>
                <p>In reality, a computer bus is a set of parallel wires that connect components of the computer to pass signals between them. The bus is split into three parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data bus</strong>: a bidirectional bus to transport data around the computer system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Address bus</strong>: a unidirectional bus to address memory and I/O locations</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Bus</strong>: a bidirectional bus to transport control signals around the computer system.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div id="io">
                <h3>Input and Output</h3>
                <p>For a computer to be useful, CPU needs to communicate with other devices, called <strong>peripherals</strong>.</p>
                <p>A <strong>peripheral</strong> is simply a device that is not part of the CPU (processor or main memory). The system bus is not connected directly to peripherals. Connected to <strong>I/O controller</strong>.</p>
                <p>There are <strong>I/O devices</strong> and <strong>I/O controllers</strong>. Devices include things like keyboards, magnetic disks, DVD-R drives and speakers. Controllers include the keyboard controller and magnetic disk controllers.</p>
                <p>Peripherals aren't connected directly to the processor as each processor would have to be designed for every possible peripheral. This is why controllers are used. They convert signals from peripherals into something that can be interpreted by the processor. Some operate in one direction (e.g. keyboard controller) and others in both (e.g. floppy disk controller).</p>
                <h4>Secondary Storage</h4>
                <p><strong>Secondary Storage</strong> is permanent storage memory. Not directly connected to processor. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Magnetic hard disk</li>
                    <li>CD-ROM,CD-R,CD-RW</li>
                    <li>DVD-ROM,DVD-R,DVD-RW</li>
                    <li>Memory stick</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="processor_func">
                <h3>Functional characteristics of a processor</h3>
                <p>Processor performs operations on data by executing program instructions. A program changes the contents of main memory by sending single words over the system bus. Program instructions and data are fetched from main memory and results are written to main memory. The processor uses numeric codes on the address bus to specify locations in main memory to choose.</p>
                <h4>Addressable memory</h4>
                <p>The processor must be able to distinguish parts of main memory. This is why each location in memory has a unique <strong>main memory address</strong>. A program requiring data from memory puts an address on the address bus. The data from that location is then sent along the data bus. All three buses are required when the processor accesses an area of main memory.</p>
                <h4>Stored program concept</h4>
                <p>The <strong>stored program concept</strong> was proposed by John von Neumann and Alan Turing separately in 1945. It said:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A program must be present in main memory to be executed.</li>
                    <li>Machine code instructions are fetched, one at a time, from main memory, and executed sequentially by the processor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Processor instructed to perform arithmetic or logic functions (e.g. AND, OR, ADD, SUBTRACT). Instructions are represented in <strong>machine code</strong>, a numeric instruction set, specific to the processor. Since each instruction is a single number, each memory location can hold one instruction.</p>
                <h4>Types of stored program computer: von Neumann vs Harvard</h4>
                <p>In a <strong>von Neumann stored program system</strong>, data and instructions are stored in the same memory so instructions cannot be fetched at the same time as data is read or written. However, in a <strong>Harvard stored program computer</strong>, there is a separate memory and buses for instructions. This means that instructions can be fetched in parallel with data read and write, increasing the overall processing speed of the system.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Microcontroller</h4>
            <p>A <strong>microcontroller</strong> is an entire computer (including processor, memory and I/O) on a single chip. Mostly used as embedded computers, where a cheap and compact programmable system is required. An <strong>embedded computer</strong> is a special purpose system inside another device. Examples are GPS systems, iPods and routers.</p>
            <div id="processor_structure">
                <h3>Structure and role of the processor</h3>
                <p>A processor comprises the following components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Program control unit</strong> fetches program instructions from memory, decodes and executes them one at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arithmetic and logic unit</strong> performs arithmetic and logical operations on inputted data. Examples include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR. Also can perform shifts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Registers</strong> are quick memory locations contained in the processor. Faster than main memory since no external buses required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal clock</strong> is derived directly or indirectly from the system clock.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal buses</strong> are buses to link the ALU, control unit and registers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logic gates</strong> is used for flow control.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>General-Purpose and dedicated registers</h4>
                <p>Registers are very fast memory locations inside the processor. <strong>General-purpose registers</strong> (R0,R1 etc.) are available for the programmer's use to store temporary data. They are not assigned a specific role by the processor designer. Accessed via instructions like <code>LOAD</code>, <code>STORE</code> and <code>ADD</code>.</p>
                <p><strong>NB: R1 is the register store with address 1. Not the same as a memory location with address 1.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Dedicated registers</strong> are those with a specific role, chosen by the processor designer. They have names like SP, PC, SR and ACC. Programmers can read and change some, but not all of these. Here are some dedicated registers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Program counter (PC)</strong>:points to next instruction to be fetched and executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Status register (SR)</strong>: holds condition codes to show the outcome of operations. Example: an arithmetic operation could produce a positive, negative, zero or overflow result. The flag is set accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accumulator (ACC)</strong>: holds the result of the current set of calculations. E.g. <code>ADD #36</code> adds the number 36 to what is currently in the ACC and then stores it again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Current instruction register (CIR)</strong>: holds the current instruction, while it is decoded and executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory address register (MAR)</strong>: holds the address of the memory location being accessed by the processor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory buffer register (MBR)</strong>: holds the data being transferred to or from the main memory location being accessed by the processor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>System clock and clock speed</h4>
                <p>Every computer system has a quartz-controlled oscillator which sends out a timing signal at a fixed rate. All other timings are derived from this system clock. Controls how fast instructions are executed and synchronises various parts of the computer. Clock rates are measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).</p>
                <p>Processors are designed to perform instructions at a specified frequency. This is called the <strong>clock speed</strong>. Each instruction is executed by the processor in a fixed number of clock cycles. Some require more cycles than others. Clock cycles are also required for operation of the system bus to transfer binary words.</p>
                <p>Computer clock speeds have been doubling roughly every year.</p>
                <h4>Word length</h4>
                <p>Computers work with binary words of specific lengths. Each wire in a bus corresponds to a bit in the maximum word length of the system. The <strong>word length</strong> is the number of bits in the word.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="performance">
                <h3>Effect of clock speed, word length and bus width on performance</h3>
                <p>For a processor, performance is how fast a specified task can be completed. The unit of performance is float-point operations per second (FLOPS).</p>
                <h4>Increasing clock speed</h4>
                <p>A processor with double the clock speed should execute the same machine code program twice as fast, as long as all other factors are constant. This is because each cycle is twice as fast so each instruction will take half the time to complete.</p>
                <h4>Limits on clock speed</h4>
                <p>A limit must be set on clock speed because otherwise, the heat generated in the chip cannot be dissipated fast enough, leading to chip damage. This problem is exacerbated when transistors are packed closer together, as the trend of Moore's law shows occurs more and more.</p>
                <h4>Multicore microprocessors</h4>
                <p>What is now done is to put more than one processor onto the chip. These <em>cores</em> operate at a lower clock speed than a single core and so the temperature problem is... dissipated. This also allows multiple tasks to be run at the same time, improving performance significantly.</p>
                <h4>Increasing word length</h4>
                <p>The word length of registers and buses affects the processor's speed performance. The word length denotes the largest number which can be computed by the system. Anything larger must be split into multiple words. This is time consuming and affects performance negatively. Typical word lengths are 32 or 64 bits. Also, since words are used for addressing, it limits the amount of memory which can be used in a system.</p>
                <h4>Increasing bus width</h4>
                <p>The worst time penalty occurs in the system bus between processor and main memory. If the CIR is not large enough to hold a complete instruction, the system bus must be used to transfer multiple words. This can slow down the processor as the system bus is a bottleneck. A wider system bus allows more data to be transferred per second and a wider address bus increases the maximum possible memory which can be installed into the computer.</p>
